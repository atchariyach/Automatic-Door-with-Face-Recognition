## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Accurately identifies authorized individuals from a live video stream.
- **Blink Liveness Detection**: A crucial security layer that requires users to blink, effectively preventing spoofing attempts using photos or videos.
- **Arduino Integration**: Sends `AUTHORIZED` and `UNAUTHORIZED` commands over a serial port to control external hardware (e.g., LEDs, relays, electric door locks).
- **Intelligent Dataset Creator**: A helper script that automates the creation of a high-quality image dataset. It only captures sharp, well-lit, and correctly posed facial images.
- **Modular & Clean Code**: The project is organized into distinct, easy-to-understand scripts for creating the dataset, training the model, and running the main application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Core Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For real-time computer vision and image processing.
  - Dlib: For high-performance face detection and facial landmark prediction.
  - Keras (with TensorFlow backend): For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
  - Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
  - PySerial: For serial communication with the Arduino board.
- **Hardware (Optional)**:
  - Webcam
  - Arduino UNO (or a compatible board)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer installed.
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed for uploading code to the Arduino board.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultimate-secure-face-recognition.git
cd ultimate-secure-face-recognition
```

### 3. Download Required Model Files

This project requires a pre-trained facial landmark predictor from dlib.
- Download **`shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`** from [dlib's official site](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2).
- Unzip the file and place the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file in the root directory of the project.

### 4. Set Up a Python Environment & Install Dependencies

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required libraries from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up the Arduino

1. Open the `arduino_code/basic_access_control.ino` file using the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
3. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct Board and Port from the `Tools` menu.
4. Click the **Upload** button.
5. Wire a red LED to Pin 8 and a green LED to Pin 9 (or modify the pins in the `.ino` file to match your setup).

## üìà Workflow

Follow these three steps in order to get the system running.

### Step 1: Create the Dataset

Run the intelligent dataset creator script. This will capture high-quality images of each person you want the system to recognize.

```bash
python create_dataset.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions (look straight, stay still) until the required number of images is captured. Repeat for each person.

### Step 2: Train the AI Model

Once the dataset is ready, train the face recognition model. This script will learn to distinguish between the individuals in your dataset.

```bash
python face_training.py
```
This process will take a few minutes. Upon completion, it will generate two crucial files: `face_recognition_model.h5` and `label_encoder.pickle`.

### Step 3: Run the Main Application

Before running, make sure to configure the correct Arduino serial port in the `face_recognition_app.py` file.

```python
# In face_recognition_app.py
ARDUINO_PORT = 'COM3' # <-- Change this to your Arduino's port (e.g., '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux)
```

Now, launch the main application:
```bash
python face_recognition_app.py
```
Look at the camera and **blink twice** to pass the liveness check. The system will then identify your face and send the appropriate signal to the Arduino.

## üìù Notes

- The accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the quality of the dataset. Ensure good lighting and varied (but slight) head poses during dataset creation.
- If you consistently encounter "Bad Pose" or "Blurry" feedback, consider adjusting the `POSE_THRESHOLD` and `BLUR_THRESHOLD` values in the `create_dataset.py` script to better suit your camera and environment.
